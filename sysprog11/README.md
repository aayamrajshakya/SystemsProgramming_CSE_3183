# Program 11: Sharing data over a FIFO

Write a set of programs that transfers string data entered in one program to the other program over a FIFO. 
<br />
The first program should prompt the user to enter words in a manner similar to the following:
<br />
`Please enter text at the producer: prompt`
<br />
`producer:`

The second program should then respond to receiving the data over the pipe by outputting
<br />
`consumer: <data received>`
