# Project 4

This program will use the file created in Program 3 labeled "angl.dat".

The goal of this program is to read the roll, pitch, and yaw values from the file and report if they are inside or outside of a given range; the range we will use is -20.0 to 20.0.

Your program should read one set of roll, pitch, and yaw values each second (remember that you have written doubles, so read doubles); it should verify if each the roll and pitch are inside the range of -20.0 to 20.0 and report the results. 

## How to run
```bash
clang main.c -o output 
./output
```
